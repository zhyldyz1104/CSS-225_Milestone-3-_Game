# CSS-225_Milestone-3-_Game

This is a text-based adventure game inspired by The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. The player follows Santiago’s journey through interactive chapters, making choices that affect the outcome. Each chapter is written as a separate Python module for modular design and easy expansion.
# 🧩 Structure
- chapter1.py – Start in Andalusia, talk to villagers, visit the gypsy, sell sheep, and begin the journey.
- chapter2.py – Explore the oasis, help the Englishman, and follow the hawk’s flight.
- chapter3.py – Meet the chieftain and the alchemist, choose whether to accept guidance and continue the desert journey.
- chapter4.py – Learn spiritual lessons, solve riddles, and reach the pyramids—or restart the game if you fail.
# 🕹️ How to Play
Run main.py to start the game. You’ll be asked whether you want to begin each chapter. Your choices will shape Santiago’s path. If you fail to solve the riddles in Chapter 4, the game restarts from Chapter 1.
